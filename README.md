Note: 
I didn't make any of the logos, CSS classes, or HTML. I copied them from google's login page, so, theyre not mine! I just coded the JS in the beginning of the file which adds classes when needed.
If you want to do it for another site or something, I used inspect element to copy the page's code, then just looked at which classes changed when you interacted with the page. Simple enough!

**Usage:**
At the semi-top of the file, theres a function called onSubmit() that is called when the form is finished. The email and password inputted is saved to userEmail and userPassword. After running, it'll change the HTML to a google error page. Change that if you want!

**My to-do list:**
- Make file smaller. Theres about 750 KB of CSS classes, and you can't really get rid of that, but some of the HTML and JS isn't needed.
- Add swipe animation for transitioning between email and password form (Impossible difficulty)
- Add go back to email if you click on the left button on the password page
- Fix password input box being a little higher than Google's
- Add different language selector
- Attempt to somewhat validate emails so that they check if the TLD is valid. 
- I had something else, but I think I forgot...
